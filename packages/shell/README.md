# Installation

> Some of the components rely on [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation), so make sure to have it installed. Namely the button, avatar and textatrea components

# init

It is recommended to install all components at once:

```
npx @shadcn-svelte-chat/cli init
```

The components will be installed in a subdirectory of the `components` folder: `src/components/ui/chat`
